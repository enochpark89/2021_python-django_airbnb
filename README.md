# Progress journal

-  If you are serious about the career as a Django developer, we recommend using Pycharm community or professional version.
-  **Jetbrains**: The company who developed Pycharm. They have IDE for many programming languages.
-  Django vs Flask:
   -  Python: mininalistic (Flask, Pyramid), simple code; lots of manual work; invent wheels
   -  Django: massive framework; comes with many utilities; Use other ppl's work; no need to reinvent wheels.
-  If you use Django template, you will save alot of time building a website.
-  A web app that requires many user interactions should use React.
-  Sometimes, you do not need React to build a website. It might be better in some cases to use Django.
-  Pip installs everything globally. So we install something like **pipenv** that install packages within your environment only. The problem with installing globally is that when there is a version update, your code might break. Therefore, it is better for you to create a bubble or a backup just incase the code breaks.
-  Tell pipenv to create an environment with Python 3 (_pipenv --three_)

## 1.0 Create Env and Install Django

1. Create a working environment directory.
2. Create a python 3 environment - _pipenv --three_ > pipfile gets created; virtual environment is created.
3. In a terminal, run _pipenv shell_ gets a developer inside a virtual environment.
4. Install Django - _pipenv install Django==2.2.5_
5. To confirm Django installation, run _django-admin_ > If successfully installed, you get [django] with many options available.

## 1.1 Create a Github Repository.

## 1.2 Test the Bubble

-  Make sure to run pipen shell so that you will be in the bubble to work on the project.
-  Please make sure to run _pipenv shell_ if you turned off the computer or VSCODE.
